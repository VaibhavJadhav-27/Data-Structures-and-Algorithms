# Problem Description : 
#   Given an n x n grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized, and return the distance. 
#   If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.
#   The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.

#  *******************************************************************
#   Input: grid = [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
#   Output: 2
#   Explanation: The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.

#   Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
#   Output: 4
#   Explanation: The cell (2, 2) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 4.
