# 🐍 Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository is my personal collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems solved in **Python**.  
Right now, it includes problems from **Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists and Stack**, and I’ll keep expanding it as I practice more topics.
